### What is a SOC Analyst

SOC standards for Security Operations Center. It's a central unit that protects the organization from cyber threats.
They work as a team and could work with other departments such as IT.

An example of the job of a SOC is when a data breach occurs with a bank. They need to contain the attack, handle the legal aspects, and remediate the vulnerability.

### Internal and External SOCs

External SOC teams are external to the organization and internal are insiders. Individuals are directly hired by the organization for internal.

### Tools

SOC Analysts use a variety of tools in their daily operations. These are some different types of technology used:

- SIEMS
- SOAR
- EDR
- XDR
- IPS/IDS

### SIEM

A dashboard that aggregates all incoming threats or logs so analysts have a bird's eye view of the network.

### Comparison between different professionals

Security engineers monitor the tools and software for vulnerability, not network. They do a lot of app sec.
(Detection Engineers)

The difference between analyst and a detection engineer is that the engineer is more focused on making effective rules for observing threats.

### SOC Tiers

There is usually a hierarchy of analysts in a particular team. Tier 1 are front line defenders, Tier 2 use more complex log to track activity, and Tier 3 uses everything they can to response to the incident. Each tier esculates to the next when they run out of resources.
