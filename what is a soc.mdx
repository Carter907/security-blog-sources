### What is a SOC Analyst

SOC standards for Security Operations Center. It's a central unit that protects the organization from cyber threats.
They work as a team and could work with other departments such as IT.

An example of the job of a SOC is when a data breach occurs with a bank. They need to contain the attack, handle the legal aspects, and remediate the vulnerability.

### Internal and External SOCs

External SOC teams are external to the organization and internal are insiders. Individuals are directly hired by the organization for internal.

### Tools

SOC Analysts use a variety of tools in their daily operations. These are some different types of technology used:

- SIEMS
- SOAR
- EDR
- XDR
- IPS/IDS

### SIEM

A dashboard that aggregates all incoming threats or logs so analysts have a bird's eye view of the network.

### Comparison between different professionals

Security engineers monitor the tools and software for vulnerability, not network. They do a lot of app sec.
(Detection Engineers)

The difference between analyst and a detection engineer is that the engineer is more focused on making effective rules for observing threats.

### SOC Tiers

There is usually a hierarchy of analysts in a particular team. Tier 1 are front line defenders, Tier 2 use more complex log to track activity, and Tier 3 uses everything they can to response to the incident. Each tier esculates to the next when they run out of resources. Tier 3 is used as a final defense against an attack once it's found and still on-going.

### Quick Vocab
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Security, Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Triage
- XDR (super EDR)
  - on multiple endpoints
- IDS/IPS
  - installed on network as opposed to XDR and EDR
- IAM
- Ticket
  - Difference between engineering and analyst ticket is that the engineering ticket is software-orientated, whereas the analyst ticket is focused on the consequences of a problem.
  - Triage and Alert (escalate)
- Ticket Escalation
- Asset
- IOC
  - evidence of attack
- Artifact
  - more general information about the incident
- Network Detection & Response (NDR)
  - EDR for network (IPS/IDS but for network and smaller cost)
  - Way more verbose; it has way more logs compared to IPS/IDS.

#### SOC-like terms
- SOC
  - work for on org
- MSSP
  - soc for hire
  - esculate to client
  - external, similar to external socs
  - reliaquest is an e.g.
- NOC
  - IT related
  - networking
  - usually internal

### SOC Philosophy

- zero trust
- empirical approach
- noramlity and sensitivity to unusual activity

### SOC Analyst Logs
There are various different kinds of events that can be documented through logs.
These are some specific types:
- Event
- System
- Access
- Server
- Change

### OSINT
Open source intelligence is a way to gather intel from open sources. Virustotal is a popular OSINT resource.

- CDN
  - A content delivery network is used to cache website content to improve performance.
