### Reddit Advice I'm gotten

- HELP-DESK WILL NOT HELP YOU GET INTO SECURITY ENGINEERING
- you need to create the foundations
- Having Real-World experience in server technology, Operating Systems, and Web servers is so important.
- AppSec = programming and security flaws.

### TryHackMe AppSec Rooms

- Web Application Pentesting
- Attacking and Defending AWS
- Defending Azure
- Offensive Pentesting
- Web fundamentals
- ComPTIA PenTest+
- Red Teaming
- Security Engineer
- Junior Penetration Tester

- Web Penetration Tester
- Senior Web Penetration Tester
- Penetration Tester
- Junior Cybersecurity Analyst

#### CCNA

Important CCNA subjects (You don't need to get the cert)
- CCNA Routing and Switching
- Security

### Programming

FOCUS ON PROGRAMMING WHILE IN COLLEGE


```
Just lay down some knowledge here to save you some heartburn and tons of money. Working in helpdesk does nothing for your career aspirations and is not needed to move up in cybersecurity, IT, networking or any other technical field. You work helpdesk when you do not have enough technical skills yet to obtain a more technical job.

You are in school for computer science, but are drifting towards career fields that pay way less and will not give you what you are looking for in a career unless you are willing to dive deep into them and not just surface level. This is why many in this field find it hard to find a job because they do not have base foundations of the things they are trying to get a job to protect or attack. Why hire someone that says they know cybersecurity, but has no clue how Linux, Windows, Web Applications work like Tomcat, Django, Flask, etc. in-depth and have never built anything on them or did anything in production in the real world. They cannot secure what they don't understand and running a vulnerability scanner won't cut it.

You will need to focus and stay focused if you are wanting to actually get into cybersecurity and not get stuck in SOC jobs forever (the bottom of the cybersecurity ladder), that path you have talked about is all over the place and will lead you down a road of low pay and misery if you continue with it.

If you want to get into AppSec you need to know how to program and find flaws in programming languages which your CS degree should very well prepare you for when you are done.

The only components on TryHackMe that will be of use for this goal are:

- Web Application Pentesting
- Attacking and Defending AWS
- Defending Azure
- Offensive Pentesting
- Web fundamentals
- ComPTIA PenTest+
- Red Teaming
- Security Engineer
- Junior Penetration Tester
    

For Hack The Box, you will want to look at the Academy and then the labs to build up your foundation.

The paths you would want to focus on are:

- Web Penetration Tester
- Senior Web Penetration Tester
- Penetration Tester
- Junior Cybersecurity Analyst
    

Then take a look at the skill paths.

You mentioned CCNA, this is a great path to having a really good understanding of networking that many people fail to build as it is a major foundational skill that you must have in cybersecurity. This is especially true due to how everything runs across the network and certain bad code can cause serious issues for the network if not caught. If you want a solid foundation look at CCNA Routing and Switching along with Security at least for the learning material (you don't have to actually get the cert).

If done right you should be able to find a job as a network penetration tester or work as a junior red team engineer due to your computer science background. This will help you get into a good team to start creating red team tools, operational tools, malware, etc. needed for your engagements.

You saw me put malware, yes with a computer science degree you should have enough solid system internals knowledge, architecture knowledge, C/C++/Python and hopefully assembly too to start building test malware, C2 systems and more for your red team infrastructure, understand how to route things securely and encrypt it and have successful engagements with customers under supervision of a senior red team member or members.

If you do not have fundamental understanding and applied hands-on knowledge with C, C++ (Windows/Linux Systems Programming, Distributed Programming, etc.), Assembly (computer architecture course), Python and or Java you should supplement with courses to fill in any gaps of knowledge.

Then combine it with the advanced math you should have taken in the degree and you are very well way overqualified to work in a helpdesk, SOC jobs with the ability to obtain better paying work and a career.

If you are still looking to get an AppSec job I would highly recommend you take a look at SJD-100 over at OffSec which should help you build a solid foundation on AppSec alone. With the other recommendations it will make you a very well rounded and proficient cybersecurity engineer and or researcher in time so you can eventually earn more and do more in cybersecurity beyond the basics.

### Main Learning Subjects

The following subjects are what i need to focus on in college:
1. Programming/software engineering (CS Major)
    - This is most important because you want to have a solid foundation to build upon and it's directly related to your major. You want to extract as much value from your major as possible.
2. Security Engineering
    - This is the security aspect of App Sec. You need to learn about the underlying concepts and technology earlier, while in college so it's easier to integrate when you make the switch.


#### How would you to determine what to learn?

The following are considered when picking a subject to learn:
- it provided necessary context for other important information
- project requirement
- fundamental knowledge

#### How far should you learn something?

**Surface Level**:
- not readily applicable to your main learning goals (see 3 above)
- extremely complex without an auxiliary concepts to help aid in understanding
- has perquisite knowledge that you haven't learned

**Deep Level**:
- If it's necessary for being an expert in my chosen career path
- if it's directly related to my current job
- if the learning path is clearly outlined
- it's both relevant and interesting
